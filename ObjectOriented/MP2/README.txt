For this assignment, a C++ program was created where fractions were represented by the class “Fraction”, containing member functions allowing for various mathematical operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) to be performed between two fractions. 

This program prompts a user to enter the numerator and denominator values for two fractions, creating two objects to represent these two fractions. The user is then prompted to enter an operator character (+, -, *, /). The operation is performed, and the resulting fraction is returned to the user. The user is then prompted to enter the letter q or Q to end the program or enter any other letter to perform a new calculation with new fractions.

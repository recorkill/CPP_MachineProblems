For this assignment, a C++ program was created in which several functions were created for the user to access. These functions were a power function, which would allow the user to provide a number and a power to raise that number to, a function to determine the total seconds in a user-provided time (in hours, minutes, and seconds), and a swap function, which would take two entries from a user and swap them. Additional functions were created to check the functionality of each of these functions.

Separately, a program was created to assess a datafile containing a list of names (students) and numbers (test scores). To fill this datafile with twenty students, various members of the San Antonio Spursâ€™ former players were chosen, and test scores were randomly assigned. The purpose of this program was to create functions to both organize the information presented in the datafile (using a Student struct to represent each student), as well as assign the students letter grades based on their scores and determine the student with the highest score in the class.

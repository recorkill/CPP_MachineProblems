For this assignment, a C++ program was created to create lists and vectors of fraction objects, as well as handle the merging and sorting of these lists. This program built off the “Fraction” class designed earlier in the semester, wherein a mathematical fraction was represented by a numerator and a denominator. This program overloaded both the >> input operator, as well as other important operators to the merging and sorting processes (==, >, etc.). When each list or vector was read from an input file, it was sorted in ascending order and checked for duplicates (which were then removed), after which it was returned to the user. Additionally, a print function was created which would display the contents of either a list or a vector, which was achieved using a template function.

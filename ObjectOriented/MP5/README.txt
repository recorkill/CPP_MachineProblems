For this assignment, a C++ program was created to collect information about different people and compile them into a list. For this program, a “Person” class was created with the data members that would be common to all entries (the person’s name, birthday, email, and phone number). However, entries were made to this list by more specific classes than the person class. These classes (“Student”, “Faculty”, and “Staff”) were derived from the Person class to include relevant information to that specific type of person (e.g., a student’s GPA and a faculty’s office number). 

This program employed what polymorphism, an important principle of object-oriented programming, in completing the assignment. The Person class, as well as an Employee class (derived from Person, and from which Faculty and Staff are derived from) were made to be pure virtual classes, allowing for dynamic creation of derived objects (Students, Faculty, or Staff) upon run-time, rather than upon compiling (as would be the case otherwise, with static binding). This principle is vital to object-oriented programming, as it affords code a level of flexibility that would be otherwise unattainable.

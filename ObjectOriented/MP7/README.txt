For this assignment, a C++ program was created wherein a template class was created to represent fractions with added input flexibility. This program builds off the “Fraction” class developed earlier in the semester, wherein a mathematical fraction was represented by a numerator and a denominator, both of which were integers. The program, however, uses a class template to allow for the creation of Fraction objects with more data types than exclusively integers. To showcase this, Fraction objects were created with characters, rather than numbers, and were then used in calculations of a four-function calculator (using the overloaded +, -, /, and * operators. When these operations were performed on characters, they behaved much differently than in the case of integers. For example, adding ‘A’ and ‘B’ adds the ASCII values of these two characters together.

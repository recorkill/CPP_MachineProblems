For this assignment, a C++ program was created with three classes: the pointType class, the circleType class, and the cylinderType class. The pointType class was first created and represented a coordinate on the x-y plane; building off this class, the circleType represented a circle with a radius and a center-point (which was, in turn, a pointType object). Using both the circleType and pointType classes, the cylinderType class was constructed with a base (which was a radius and a pointType centerpoint) and a height (i.e., the cylinderType class was derived from the circleType class).

This program employed the concept of inheritance, an important aspect of object-oriented programming where objects and classes can be based on one another, inheriting information. For example, a cylinder object with a center-point at the origin, radius of 5, and height of 10 would have inherited its center-point and radius from a circle with a radius of 5 and a center-point at the origin, which itself inherited its center-point from a point at the origin.

The main program for this assignment showcases each function and aspect of all three classes, such as calculation functions (area, volume, circumference, and surface area), as well as various functions to get and set values and various constructors for each class.

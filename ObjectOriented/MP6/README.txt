For this assignment, a C++ program was created, wherein a custom array class was constructed. This array class, “myArray”, was created for two specific purposes. First, this class was created to address problems that can occur in C++ when an array is called with an out-of-bounds index. This problem was addressed in the myArray class by returning an error message and terminating the program whenever an out-of-bounds index is used. Second, this class sought to allow users to begin an array at any integer value, whether it be positive or negative. Additionally, this class sought to create arrays using dynamic memory allocation, using the keywords “new” and “delete[]” to dynamically allocate and release memory, a good practice for high-performing code. 

To demonstrate this program, three sample arrays were created, mirroring those given on Blackboard as an example. The arrays were initialized to 0, and two of the three were assigned values to highlight both the array initialization values and their ability to be set to new values. The three arrays were then printed, showing the values previously assigned to them. Lastly, to show the handling of problems that can be encountered by out-of-bounds index values, an out-of-bounds index was called on one of the lists, resulting in an error message and the termination of the program.

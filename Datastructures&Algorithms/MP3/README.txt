For this assignment, a C++ program was created that contained a “LinkedList” class, developed to represent the functionality of the singly linked-list data structure. Using this class, two linked-lists were created, containing sorted (in ascending order) random integer values between 0 and 100. These two lists were merged into a final, sorted list from which duplicates were removed. Functions were also created to find the sum and average value of the link lists and were used to find these values for the merged list. Each of the three linked-lists were printed for the user.

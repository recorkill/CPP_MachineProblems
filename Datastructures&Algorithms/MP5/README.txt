For this assignment, a C++ program was created to demonstrate the construction of binary search trees, as well as showcase various methods of traversing a search tree (postorder, preorder, and inorder). A binary search tree class (“BST”) was created and was used in the main program to create three BST objects. The user was prompted to enter a line of text, from which each word was inserted into the first BST (with repeated words that were already stored being skipped). This first tree was traversed postorder, with each entry being printed and added to the next BST object. The process was repeated on the second BST, though using preorder traversal instead to create a third BST. This third and final BST was traversed and printed inorder. Finally, the height (layers extending from the root) and total number of leaves were printed for each tree.

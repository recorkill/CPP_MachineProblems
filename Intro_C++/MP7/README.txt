For this assignment, a C++ program was created to assess a score report from a diving competition, organize the competitors and their scores, and return them to the user in an organized format to the user, with the winner noted. Each diver was scored out of 10 by eight judges, and a difficulty was assigned to the dive they performed. The total score was determined by multiplying the difficulty of the dive by the sum the judges’ scores.

This program made us of the “struct” data type to organize the divers’ names and total scores. Taking, as input, a text file containing the divers’ names, dive difficulties, and scores, the program summed each diver’s scores and calculated the total points earned by the diver. The diver’s name and total points were then stored in a “struct”, which streamlined the process of assessing the winning diver’s name and points total.

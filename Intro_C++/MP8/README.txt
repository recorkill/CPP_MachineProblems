For this assignment, a C++ program was created to explore the use of classes in programming. The assignment focused on books and their accompanying information (author, title, and ISBN number). A class was constructed to represent a book with this information, and the class was initially tested by taking an input file containing information for one book and assigning this information to a book variable. This book was then compared to a book with no information provided as comparison. 

Afterwards, the program was expanded to compile information for a small library of 10 books, with a text file containing 30 lines (three for each book) being provided. The program compiled this information into a library. The program also employed the use of a binary search to allow for users to provide ISBN numbers and identify whether a book with that ISBN number is present in the library.

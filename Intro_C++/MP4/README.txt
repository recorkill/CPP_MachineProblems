For this assignment, a C++ program was created to perform mathematical calculations on a pair of Roman numerals. This task was completed by employing a set of functions to perform each necessary task (converting between roman numerals and numbers, performing the calculation, reading the input file, etc.). This program took a text file as input, with each line in the file equating to one calculation to be performed. Each line was structured as [Roman Numeral 1] [Roman Numeral 2] [operator]. The program read these three components from each line, and printed out the result of the calculation, both as a number and as a Roman numeral.

For this assignment, a C++ program was created to create a cipher from a keyword and use that cipher to both encrypt and decrypt different phrases. For this assignment, the encryption rules for a given letter were to find the row and column that letter was found on the cipher and take the letter at the mirror of that position (i.e., with row number equal to the column number of the given letter). 

The input for this assignment was given as a text file, wherein the first line contained a keyword, and each line after contained a phrase to be either encrypted or decrypted. The distinction between encrypting and decrypting was made by the first letter of each line (E for encrypting, D for decrypting). This program constructed a cipher and read each phrase, making the appropriate changes to the phrase before printing it back out for the user.

For this assignment, a C++ program was created to assess students applying to either the Music or Liberal Arts department of a University. The program was made to take, as input, a text file containing each applicant on a line, with the school they were applying to, legacy status, and qualifications (SAT scores, GPA, etc.). Informed with the criteria of admission for each school, the program was to make a decision on whether the student should be accepted, based on SAT scores, GPA requirements, legacy status, and whether the school they were applying to was already full.

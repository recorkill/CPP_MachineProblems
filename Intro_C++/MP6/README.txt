For this assignment, a C++ program was created to read unformatted names from a text file and automatically reformat them, with correct titles assigned. All names were preceded by two characters, denoting the gender and marital status of the person, followed by the last and first name (comma separated) and middle initial (if applicable). This task was completed in two separate steps. The first step, assigning the proper title, was accomplished by reading the marital status and gender of the person, and generating the appropriate title.
 
 The second step, cleaning up the names and isolating the first and last names (and middle initial, if applicable), was accomplished using string functions. Knowing that a comma would separate the first and last names, and that a period would be present if the middle initial was given, it was possible to isolate each of these names individually and reformat them.
